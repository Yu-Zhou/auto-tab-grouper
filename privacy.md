# Privacy Policy for Auto Tab Grouper Chrome Extension

Effective date: [June 14, 2025]

Thank you for using the Auto Tab Grouper Chrome Extension. Your privacy is important to us. This policy outlines what data the extension accesses and how it is handled.

## 1. Data Collection

The Auto Tab Grouper extension **does not collect**, store, or transmit any personal or identifiable user data to any server.

The extension only interacts with:

- The URLs and tab metadata that Chrome makes available through its Extensions API.
- These are used **locally on your device** to group tabs intelligently by their origin.

We do **not** track user activity or browsing history beyond what is required for tab grouping logic.

## 2. Data Usage

All data processed by the extension remains within your browser environment and is used solely to:

- Determine tab relationships (e.g., which tab opened another).
- Create or manage tab groups for a better browsing experience.

We do not use this data for analytics, advertising, or profiling.

## 3. Data Sharing

No data is sent to external servers. We do not share, sell, or disclose any user data to third parties.

## 4. Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

- `tabs` and `tabGroups` – to read tab relationships and organize them into groups.
- `webNavigation` – to detect whether a tab was typed or clicked.

These permissions are only used for internal logic and **never for data collection**.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

Any future updates to this policy will be reflected here. You are encouraged to review this page periodically.

## 6. Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Yu-Zhou/auto-tab-grouper/issues).
